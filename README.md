## What Raw-Material is All About: 

* **Pitch**: 
Smooth looking, modern online shopping experience for high-end quality morning beverage products like whole leaf tea and whole bean coffee

* **What problem or pain point does it solve?** 
People who don’t live near city centers with h-q products can now have access to organic, whole leaf/whole bean products for fresh tea and coffee at their rural locations. Also helps city center people avoid traffic and paying for parking with online shopping. 

* **Minimum MVP definition**: 
Choose an Item & Quantity and Add it to the Cart page. There will be a Home page, About Us page, and Cart page.

**This site involved utilizing local storage to save selected items into a cart and remove them**
